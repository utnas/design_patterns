==Motivation

When we design software applications we can consider the low level classes the classes which implement basic and primary operations(disk access, network protocols,...) and high level classes the classes which encapsulate complex logic(business flows, ...). The last ones rely on the low level classes. A natural way of implementing such structures would be to write low level classes and once we have them to write the complex high level classes. Since high level classes are defined in terms of others this seems the logical way to do it. But this is not a flexible design. What happens if we need to replace a low level class?

Let's take the classical example of a copy module which reads characters from the keyboard and writes them to the printer device. The high level class containing the logic is the Copy class. The low level classes are KeyboardReader and PrinterWriter.

In a bad design the high level class uses directly and depends heavily on the low level classes. In such a case if we want to change the design to direct the output to a new FileWriter class we have to make changes in the Copy class. (Let's assume that it is a very complex class, with a lot of logic and really hard to test).

In order to avoid such problems we can introduce an abstraction layer between high level classes and low level classes. Since the high level modules contain the complex logic they should not depend on the low level modules so the new abstraction layer should not be created based on low level modules. Low level modules are to be created based on the abstraction layer.

According to this principle the way of designing a class structure is to start from high level modules to the low level modules:
High Level Classes --> Abstraction Layer --> Low Level Classes
